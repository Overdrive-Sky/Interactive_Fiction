Thank you for trying out Xenosophia! 

This game is a text-based adventure game, and as such, if one is not familiar with the regular commands associated with this type of ordeal, getting to grips with the game can be a bit hard. Nonetheless, fret not, for that is the purpose of manuals, or in this case, README files. Over the next couple of lines, interaction with the game will be described, in order to provide the best experience to the player, and prevent that same information from clogging up the game itself. Read-on, and enjoy the game!

INSTRUCTIONS:
-Progression on the game is mostly done through interaction with the environment, be it characters or objects. Like a wise man once said though, "If you don't know what to do, you can't go through.", so knowing what you are working with is half the battle. 

-This is done through the LOOK command. By using the command by itself, you can get a description of your surroundings, but by pairing it up with a name, like most other commands for that matter, you can extend its functionality to various objects. LOOK only works on objects that you are carrying with you or that are present in the surrounding environment though, so be careful. If you master this simple command, getting through the game should be a breeze, as everything has a description, and in that description is often the knowledge needed to progress. EXAMINE/EXAM can also be used, or if you just want to know your surroundings, you can also type L as a shorthand.

-The GET/TAKE/PICK UP command can be used to pick up objects, assuming, that is, they are pickable in the first place. These objects are then placed in your inventory, and can be discarded into the current area using the DROP command. Both of these commands are paired up with a name, such as [key], or [bottle], as in "GET [bottle]".

-INVENTORY/INV/I lists all the items you are currently carrying.

-GO is the command to move throughout the world. Can be used with other keywords such as IN/OUT/NORTH/SOUTH/EAST/WEST, or you can use the keywords by themselves. Cardinal directions can be abbreviated to the initials, such as N/S/E/W.

-USE is the command to… use objects of course. This verb can be paired with a name, or can be used to link two objects by typing “USE [object] on [object]”.

-Throughout the game, you will be accompanied by a companion that can offer several useful information. To talk to NPCs, you can use the command TALK/SPEAK TO, as in “SPEAK to [character]”, for example.

-Other verbs can be used as commands to interact with the world, but it will be obvious when something other than USE or GET is required to progress.
